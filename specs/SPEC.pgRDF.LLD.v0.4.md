and OWL 2 RL reasoning.**

*Positioning: pgRDF — the high-performance PostgreSQL semantic-web toolkit.*

---

## 0. Document status and supersession

- **Status:** in-progress authoritative contract for the v0.4 cycle.
  Items mark as shipped (✅) when they land on `main`, regardless of
  whether the v0.4.0 tag has cut yet. Items still in progress are
  marked 🚧. The document is authoritative now — not aspirational —
  even though the cycle is mid-flight.
- **Supersedes:** [`SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.3.md`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.3.md)
  at the contract level for surfaces shipped in the v0.4 cycle.
  v0.3 LLD remains the verbatim record of the v0.3.0-cut surface.
- **Forward-looking sibling:** [`SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE.md`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE.md)
  is the draft target spec for the next cut beyond v0.4. The
  `-FUTURE` postfix on that sibling signals it is aspirational.
- **Carries forward:** [`SPEC.pgRDF.INSTALL.v0.2.md`](SPEC.pgRDF.INSTALL.v0.2.md)
  (no install-spec changes anticipated for v0.4) and
  [`ERRATA.v0.4.md`](ERRATA.v0.4.md) (authoritative for v0.4-era spec
  deltas). [`ERRATA.v0.2.md`](ERRATA.v0.2.md) remains live for
  pre-v0.3 items.
- **Reason for v0.4:** the v0.3 cut closes Phase 2's SPARQL surface
  to the line at which a substantial class of downstream consumers
  — operators with named-graph workloads, applications performing
  atomic write-back via SPARQL, validation tooling, reasoners
  selecting between RDFS and OWL 2 RL profiles, and consumers
  traversing transitive class hierarchies via `rdfs:subClassOf*`-style
  paths — start running into the same handful of gaps. v0.4 closes
  the highest-leverage gaps as a coherent group; the residual items
  carried over move to
  [`SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE.md`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE.md).
- **Tense discipline:** v0.4 is authoritative-in-progress. Shipped
  items (✅) describe reality in present tense. In-progress items
  (🚧) use future tense ("will land", "ships with") until they
  actually land — at which point this document is updated to flip
  the marker and the tense in the same slice that lands the work.

## 1. Mission (unchanged from v0.3)

pgRDF is a PostgreSQL extension built entirely in Rust using `pgrx`.
It provides native storage and querying for RDF data directly
inside Postgres, with four engines:

1. **Storage Engine** — dictionary-encoded terms in
   `_pgrdf_dictionary`; quads in `_pgrdf_quads` partitioned by
   `graph_id`; hexastore covering indexes (SPO, POS, OSP).
2. **SPARQL Engine** — `pgrdf.sparql(q TEXT) → SETOF JSONB`;
   spargebra parser; dynamic-SQL executor with prepared-plan cache.
3. **Inference Engine** — OWL 2 RL materialisation via `reasonable`.
4. **Validation Engine** — SHACL Core via `shacl 0.3.x` (rudof
   project). Real W3C-shape report ✅ shipped in v0.4 cycle (§9),
   replacing the v0.3 stub. Unblock vehicle:
   [`ERRATA.v0.4`](ERRATA.v0.4.md) E-011.

## 2. Scope of v0.4

v0.4 ships six major tracks, plus the SPARQL surface backlog
already enumerated in [`v0.3 §3`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.3.md) as
"⏳ v0.4":

1. **Named-graph scoping and IRI mapping** (§3) — `GRAPH { … }` in
   SPARQL, a new `_pgrdf_graphs` system table, IRI ↔ `graph_id`
   helper UDFs. 🚧
2. **SPARQL UPDATE** (§4) — `INSERT DATA`, `DELETE DATA`,
   `INSERT … WHERE …`, `DELETE … WHERE …`,
   `DELETE … INSERT … WHERE …`, and the graph-scoped variants
   (`WITH <iri>`, inline `GRAPH <iri> { … }`). 🚧
3. **Graph-level lifecycle UDFs** (§5) — `drop_graph`, `clear_graph`,
   `copy_graph`, `move_graph` as state-management primitives over
   the LIST-partitioned `_pgrdf_quads` table. 🚧
4. **CONSTRUCT** (§6) — `pgrdf.construct(q TEXT) → SETOF JSONB`
   returning `{subject, predicate, object}`-shaped rows. 🚧
5. **Property paths** (§7) — `*`, `+`, `?`, `^`, with alternation
   `p1|p2` as a stretch. Materialised-closure-aware translation. 🚧
6. **SHACL real validation** (§9) — `pgrdf.validate(data, shapes)`
   ships the real W3C-shaped report; the v0.3 stub is gone. ✅
   shipped on `main` in commit
   [`ac40bc2`](https://github.com/styk-tv/pgRDF/commit/ac40bc2). See
   ERRATA.v0.4 E-011.

Plus the v0.3-deferred SPARQL surface items (§11): multi-triple
OPTIONAL, VALUES, BIND-downstream, aggregates over UNION, DESCRIBE.
These share enough translator machinery with §4 and §6 that they
ship in the same cut for economy. 🚧

Capability matrix for the v0.4 target:

| Capability | v0.3 status | v0.4 target | v0.4 status |

| Federated `SERVICE` | ❌ | — | ❌ out of scope (§14) |

## 3. Named-graph scoping and IRI mapping (NEW)

Named-graph workloads are first-class in pgRDF: storage already
partitions `_pgrdf_quads` by `graph_id` (LIST partition), and the
v0.3 cut ships `pgrdf.add_graph(id BIGINT)` and `pgrdf.count_quads`
filtered by graph. What's missing is the **IRI ↔ id binding** and
the **SPARQL `GRAPH { … }` surface**. v0.4 closes both. 🚧

Downstream consumers running graph-level lifecycle operations
(drop / clear / copy / move — §5) and atomic write-back via SPARQL
UPDATE (§4) need the IRI mapping as a hard prerequisite: a SPARQL
query writes `GRAPH <http://example.org/g1>`, and pgRDF has to
resolve `<http://example.org/g1>` to the integer `graph_id` of the
backing partition without forcing the caller to track the integer
out-of-band.

### 3.1 Storage extension — `_pgrdf_graphs`

**Status: landed (Phase A countdown slice 120).** Schema lives in
[`sql/schema_v0_4_0_graphs.sql`](../sql/schema_v0_4_0_graphs.sql),
wired into `CREATE EXTENSION pgrdf` via the second
`extension_sql_file!` call in
[`src/lib.rs`](../src/lib.rs). Regression coverage:
[`tests/regression/sql/72-graphs-table-shape.sql`](../tests/regression/sql/72-graphs-table-shape.sql)
+ `#[pg_test]` in
[`src/storage/graphs.rs`](../src/storage/graphs.rs).

```sql
CREATE TABLE _pgrdf_graphs (
    graph_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    iri      TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
```

- New system table, shipped via the same `extension_sql_file!`
  mechanism that lands the rest of the v0.3 schema.
- **Migration discipline:** on `CREATE EXTENSION pgrdf UPDATE`, any
  pre-existing `graph_id` rows already populated by
  `pgrdf.add_graph(id BIGINT)` gain a synthetic IRI of the form
  `urn:pgrdf:graph:{id}`. This preserves round-trip identity for
  v0.3 databases without requiring the caller to assign IRIs
  retroactively.
- **pg_dump round-trip:** the table is `pg_dump`-included
  unconditionally; the mapping survives backup and restore.
- **Default partition** retains `graph_id = 0` semantics from v0.3
  (catch-all for un-IRI-bound writes). Synthetic IRI:
  `urn:pgrdf:graph:0`.

### 3.2 UDF surface

| UDF | Signature | Returns | Semantics |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pgrdf.add_graph(iri TEXT)` | overload ✅ slice 118 | `BIGINT` | Idempotent on the IRI: insert if absent (auto-allocated id via `COALESCE(MAX(graph_id), 0) + 1` under `LOCK TABLE _pgrdf_graphs IN SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE`), return existing id otherwise. Empty / whitespace-only IRI panics with the stable `add_graph: iri must be non-empty` prefix; IRI syntax (RFC 3987) is not validated in v0.4.1. |
| `pgrdf.add_graph(id BIGINT, iri TEXT)` | overload ✅ slice 117 | `BIGINT` | Explicit id binding. Idempotent on a matching `(id, iri)` pair; panics with the stable `add_graph:` prefix if `id` is bound to a different non-synthetic IRI (`add_graph: graph_id <N> is bound to a different IRI (<existing>)`) or `iri` is bound to a different graph_id (`add_graph: iri <iri> is bound to a different graph_id (<existing>)`). A synthetic placeholder `urn:pgrdf:graph:{id}` (the slice-119 seed for the integer overload) is treated as upgradable: the row is UPDATEd in place when the requested IRI is unbound elsewhere. Negative id and empty IRI rejected with the same stable prefixes shared by the other two overloads. |
| `pgrdf.add_graph(id BIGINT)` | retained | `BIGINT` | Back-compat with v0.3; assigns synthetic IRI `urn:pgrdf:graph:{id}` automatically as of slice 119 (`ON CONFLICT (graph_id) DO NOTHING` keeps idempotency intact). |
| `pgrdf.graph_id(iri TEXT)` | new ✅ slice 116 | `BIGINT` | Read-only lookup: returns the integer `graph_id` bound to `iri` in `_pgrdf_graphs`, or `NULL` if the IRI is not bound. Marked `STRICT` — NULL input short-circuits to NULL output without invoking the function body. No panic on miss; an actual SPI error still propagates with the stable `graph_id:` prefix. |
| `pgrdf.graph_iri(id BIGINT)` | new ✅ slice 115 | `TEXT` | Read-only lookup: returns the IRI bound to `graph_id` in `_pgrdf_graphs`, or `NULL` if the id is not bound. Marked `STRICT` — NULL input short-circuits to NULL output without invoking the function body. No panic on miss; an actual SPI error still propagates with the stable `graph_iri:` prefix. Symmetric inverse of `pgrdf.graph_id(iri)` above. |

With slice 115 landed the §3.2 UDF surface is now fully shipped
(all five rows ✅). The integer-id and IRI surfaces are
interchangeable at the UDF boundary. `pgrdf.put_quad`,
`pgrdf.count_quads`, and the lifecycle UDFs in §5 retain their
`BIGINT graph_id` argument forms; an IRI-keyed overload moves to
[`v0.5-FUTURE §7`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE.md). SPARQL
`GRAPH { … }` translation lands next in slices 114-110.

### 3.3 SPARQL GRAPH support

- **`GRAPH <iri> { … }`** resolves `<iri>` against `_pgrdf_graphs.iri`
  to a `graph_id`. Unresolved IRI ⇒ zero rows (spec-correct "no
  solutions"; no error raised).
- **`GRAPH ?g { … }`** projects `?g` as the **IRI** (NOT the integer
  id) — bound by a JOIN against `_pgrdf_graphs`. This is
  user-visible; callers see and write IRIs, never the dictionary id.
- Composition discipline:
  - `GRAPH { … }` composes inside `OPTIONAL`, `UNION`, and `MINUS`
    blocks. Translation reuses the v0.3 `build_from_and_where`
    layout, threading a new `graph_id` (or `graph_iri`) join
    constraint per pattern.
  - Nested `GRAPH` blocks resolve to the innermost scope at AST-walk
    time (per W3C SPARQL 1.1 §13.3).
  - A bare BGP outside any `GRAPH { … }` continues to mean "match in
    any graph" — same semantics as v0.3 (`pgrdf.sparql` over the
    union of all partitions).

### 3.4 Acceptance criteria (v0.4 gate)

- `SELECT ?s WHERE { GRAPH <http://example.org/g1> { ?s ?p ?o } }`
  returns only the triples in the graph mapped to
  `<http://example.org/g1>`. Triples in other graphs are not
  surfaced.
- `SELECT ?g (COUNT(*) AS ?n) WHERE { GRAPH ?g { ?s ?p ?o } } GROUP BY ?g`
  groups by IRI; `?g` projects as a `NamedNode` JSONB term, not as
  an integer.
- `pgrdf.add_graph('http://example.org/g1')` is idempotent — a
  second call against the same IRI returns the same integer id.
- `pgrdf.add_graph(42, 'http://example.org/g42')` followed by
  `pgrdf.graph_id('http://example.org/g42')` returns `42`.
- `pg_dump` of a pgRDF database carrying the mapping round-trips
  the mapping verbatim (covered by a regression fixture that
  dumps, drops, restores, and re-queries).

## 4. SPARQL UPDATE (NEW)

Applications running INSERT / DELETE / MODIFY against pgRDF need
the operations to land **inside a single Postgres transaction** —
the same transaction context as any surrounding SQL the caller has
open. v0.3 supports SELECT and ASK only. v0.4 adds the UPDATE
surface. 🚧

### 4.1 Surface

| Form | Notes |
|---|---|
| `INSERT DATA { … }` | Direct triple insertion (single triple or BGP-style block). Constants only — no variables. |
| `DELETE DATA { … }` | Direct triple removal. Constants only. |
| `INSERT { template } WHERE { pattern }` | Pattern-driven insertion. Each solution of `WHERE` instantiates `template` once. |
| `DELETE { template } WHERE { pattern }` | Pattern-driven removal. |
| `DELETE { … } INSERT { … } WHERE { … }` | Atomic modify — both operations run against the same `WHERE` solutions snapshot. |
| `WITH <iri> …` | Graph scope for the surrounding INSERT/DELETE/WHERE. |
| `INSERT { GRAPH <iri> { … } }` | Inline graph scope on the template. |
| `DELETE { GRAPH <iri> { … } }` | Inline graph scope on the template. |

The graph-scoped variants compose with §3's IRI mapping: every
`<iri>` resolves to a `graph_id` via `_pgrdf_graphs.iri`. Unknown
IRIs auto-allocate (default behaviour, matching `add_graph(iri)`).

### 4.2 Wiring

**UDF surface decision.** v0.4 overloads `pgrdf.sparql(q TEXT)` to
dispatch by query form rather than introducing a sibling
`pgrdf.sparql_update`. Rationale: clients shouldn't need to know
which UDF to call before parsing the query string. The return type
remains `SETOF JSONB`; UPDATE forms return a single summary row of
shape:

```json
{
  "_update": {
    "form": "DELETE_INSERT_WHERE",
    "triples_inserted": 1000,
    "triples_deleted": 1000,
    "graphs_touched": ["http://example.org/g1"],
    "elapsed_ms": 12
  }
}
```

The `_update` JSONB sentinel parallels the v0.3 `_ask` sentinel for
ASK queries — callers discriminate on the leading key.

**Algebra.** `spargebra` already parses UPDATE forms via
`SparqlParser::new().parse_update(q)` returning `spargebra::Update`,
a vector of `GraphUpdateOperation`s. The translator walks that
algebra parallel to the SELECT translation in
`src/query/executor.rs`, dispatching per operation variant
(`InsertData`, `DeleteData`, `DeleteInsert`, `Load`, `Clear`,
`Create`, `Drop`, `Add`, `Move`, `Copy`).

**Transaction discipline.** The UDF runs inside the calling
Postgres transaction. One `pgrdf.sparql(q)` call is one transaction
unit (no implicit commits). The caller controls commit boundaries
via standard SQL `BEGIN / COMMIT / ROLLBACK`. Operations that
straddle multiple UPDATE forms (e.g. `DELETE_INSERT_WHERE`) execute
as a single SQL statement-equivalent: the `WHERE` is evaluated
once, both DELETE and INSERT templates resolve against the same
solution set, and they apply atomically.

**INSERT-from-WHERE.** The synthesised inserts route through the
existing batched `flush_batch` prepared-plan path from
[`v0.3 §4.3`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.3.md). Throughput on bulk
`INSERT { … } WHERE { … }` matches bulk `pgrdf.load_turtle` to
within a constant factor.

### 4.3 `pgrdf.sparql_parse` integration

`pgrdf.sparql_parse(q TEXT)` already parses UPDATE shapes through
the same `spargebra` entry point. v0.4 revs the JSONB return to
surface the UPDATE form variants explicitly:

```json
{
  "form": "UPDATE",
  "operations": [
    {"op": "InsertData", "triples": 5, "graphs": ["http://example.org/g1"]},
    {"op": "DeleteInsert", "delete_template_size": 1, "insert_template_size": 1, "where_pattern_size": 3}
  ],
  "unsupported_algebra": []
}
```

Callers running multi-statement UPDATE preview translatability per
operation; partial-support cases (e.g. `LOAD <url>` — explicitly
out of scope, see §14) surface in `unsupported_algebra`.

### 4.4 Lifecycle algebra ↔ §5 UDFs

`spargebra::Update` includes `Drop`, `Clear`, `Create`, `Add`,
`Move`, and `Copy` operations. v0.4 wires these to the lifecycle
UDFs from §5 — the SPARQL UPDATE surface and the SQL UDF surface
are two front-ends to the same partition-level primitives. Both
honour the IRI mapping from §3.

| SPARQL form | Backing UDF |
|---|---|
| `DROP GRAPH <iri>` | `pgrdf.drop_graph(graph_id(iri))` |
| `CLEAR GRAPH <iri>` | `pgrdf.clear_graph(graph_id(iri))` |
| `CREATE GRAPH <iri>` | `pgrdf.add_graph(iri)` |
| `COPY <src> TO <dst>` | `pgrdf.copy_graph(graph_id(src), graph_id(dst))` |
| `MOVE <src> TO <dst>` | `pgrdf.move_graph(graph_id(src), graph_id(dst))` |
| `ADD <src> TO <dst>` | `pgrdf.copy_graph` (ADD = COPY without first-clearing dst per W3C SPARQL 1.1 Update §3.2.6) |

### 4.5 Acceptance criteria (v0.4 gate)

- One `INSERT DATA { … }` of N triples ≡ one Postgres transaction,
  observable via `pg_stat_xact_user_tables`.
- `INSERT { ?x ex:tag "t" } WHERE { ?x rdf:type ex:Item }` over
  1 000 matched items adds 1 000 triples in one round trip (no
  per-row UDF re-entry).
- Round-tripping through `pgrdf.sparql_parse` and `pgrdf.sparql`
  for the same UPDATE produces equivalent state to direct
  `pgrdf.put_quad` calls reproducing the same set.
- `DELETE { … } INSERT { … } WHERE { … }` is atomic — a rollback
  on the surrounding transaction leaves the graph state unchanged.
- `pgrdf.sparql('DROP GRAPH <http://example.org/g1>')` is
  equivalent to `pgrdf.drop_graph(pgrdf.graph_id('http://example.org/g1'))`.

## 5. Graph-level lifecycle UDFs (NEW)

Consumers running graph-level lifecycle operations as part of
their state-management need drop / clear / copy / move primitives
that operate at the **partition level** — not as N-row DELETE
loops. v0.4 lands four UDFs that exploit `_pgrdf_quads`'s LIST
partitioning. 🚧

### 5.1 Surface

| UDF | Signature | Returns | Semantics |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pgrdf.drop_graph(id BIGINT, cascade BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE)` | new | `BIGINT` | Removes the partition entirely; returns the count of triples that were in it. `cascade => FALSE` errors if inferred rows are present. |
| `pgrdf.clear_graph(id BIGINT)` | new | `BIGINT` | `TRUNCATE ONLY` the partition; the partition itself is preserved (so subsequent inserts route normally). Returns triples removed. |
| `pgrdf.copy_graph(src BIGINT, dst BIGINT)` | new | `BIGINT` | Copies all quads from `src` to `dst`. Creates the `dst` partition if absent. Returns triples copied. |
| `pgrdf.move_graph(src BIGINT, dst BIGINT)` | new | `BIGINT` | Atomic association swap: the `src` partition's `FOR VALUES IN (...)` clause rebinds to the new id. Returns triples moved (== row count at swap time). |

IRI overloads (`pgrdf.drop_graph(iri TEXT)`, etc.) deferred to
[`v0.5-FUTURE §7`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE.md); in v0.4 callers
route IRI input through `pgrdf.graph_id(iri)` explicitly.

### 5.2 Implementation notes

- `_pgrdf_quads` is LIST-partitioned on `graph_id` per v0.3 §4. The
  lifecycle UDFs lean on Postgres's partition-management DDL:
  - `drop_graph` issues
    `ALTER TABLE _pgrdf_quads DETACH PARTITION ...` then
    `DROP TABLE`. The detach is metadata-only; the subsequent drop
    drops the partition table's own row storage and indexes. Cost
    is independent of row count (modulo btree page release).
  - `move_graph` is also metadata-only: rebind the partition's
    `FOR VALUES IN (<old_id>)` clause to `FOR VALUES IN (<new_id>)`.
    Postgres requires DETACH + ATTACH for this; the DETACH/ATTACH
    pair runs under an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on the parent for a
    bounded window. Backing rows do not move.
  - `clear_graph` is `TRUNCATE ONLY` on the partition — bulk row
    discard with the partition shell preserved.
  - `copy_graph` is the only one that touches every row:
    `INSERT INTO _pgrdf_quads SELECT subject_id, predicate_id, object_id, <dst>, is_inferred FROM _pgrdf_quads WHERE graph_id = <src>`.
- **`is_inferred` semantics:**
  - `drop_graph` removes both base and inferred rows (cascade is
    the default).
  - `clear_graph` removes both base and inferred.
  - `copy_graph` copies both — `is_inferred = TRUE` rows carry
    forward as `is_inferred = TRUE` in the destination.
  - `move_graph` is metadata-only — `is_inferred` flags are
    preserved trivially.
- **`_pgrdf_graphs` invalidation:** `drop_graph` removes the
  matching `(graph_id, iri)` row. `move_graph` rebinds the IRI to
  the new id (the source id becomes unbound). `copy_graph` allocates
  a fresh IRI for `dst` if `dst` is not already bound (synthetic
  `urn:pgrdf:graph:{dst}`).
- **Idempotency:** every UDF returns 0 (no-op) on inputs that name
  an empty or absent graph — never an error.
- **Concurrency:** the partition-DDL UDFs (`drop_graph`,
  `move_graph`) take an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on `_pgrdf_quads`
  for the metadata window. Concurrent SELECT/UPDATE traffic on
  unrelated graphs blocks for the duration; this is documented in
  the guide as part of the "long-running maintenance" workflow.

### 5.3 Acceptance criteria (v0.4 gate)

- **Idempotency.** Re-calling any of the four UDFs with the same
  input is a no-op and returns `0`.
- **Constant-time move.** `pgrdf.move_graph(src, dst)` execution
  time is independent of `_pgrdf_quads` row count in `src`
  (measured: < 100 ms for a graph of 1 000 000 quads; covered by a
  performance regression fixture).
- **Cascade guard.** `pgrdf.drop_graph(id, cascade => FALSE)`
  errors with prefix `drop_graph: inferred rows present` if any
  `is_inferred = TRUE` row exists in the graph.
- **IRI mapping consistency.** After `pgrdf.drop_graph(id)`,
  `pgrdf.graph_iri(id)` returns `NULL` and the row is gone from
  `_pgrdf_graphs`. After `pgrdf.move_graph(src, dst)`,
  `pgrdf.graph_iri(src)` returns `NULL` and `pgrdf.graph_iri(dst)`
  returns the IRI previously bound to `src` (or synthetic if
  unbound).

## 6. CONSTRUCT (deferred from v0.3, now in scope)

`CONSTRUCT` is the canonical SPARQL form for graph snapshot export,
Turtle output, and sub-graph extraction. v0.3 lists it as
deferred-to-v0.4 because its return shape (triples, not solutions)
diverges from the `pgrdf.sparql` JSONB row shape. 🚧

### 6.1 Surface decision

v0.4 adds a sibling UDF rather than overloading `pgrdf.sparql`:

```sql
pgrdf.construct(q TEXT) → SETOF JSONB
```

Each row has the shape `{"subject": ..., "predicate": ..., "object": ...}`,
where each value is itself a structured JSONB term using the same
term-encoding shaper as `pgrdf.sparql`:

```json
{
  "subject":   {"type": "iri",     "value": "http://example.org/Alice"},
  "predicate": {"type": "iri",     "value": "http://example.org/name"},
  "object":    {"type": "literal", "value": "Alice", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"}
}
```

**Rationale for not overloading.** The caller signals intent at the
SQL boundary, which simplifies result-set typing in client
libraries. A future `pgrdf.construct_turtle(q TEXT) → TEXT`
convenience wrapper will compose via `oxttl` serialisation —
serialising the same row shape into Turtle is a one-pass
projection and slots cleanly into the v0.3 ingest pipeline
(`pgrdf.load_turtle(pgrdf.construct_turtle(...), graph_id)`).

### 6.2 Translation

`CONSTRUCT { template } WHERE { pattern }` compiles to:

```sql
SELECT subject_id, predicate_id, object_id
FROM (<BGP translation of pattern>)
```

…then projects each `(subject_id, predicate_id, object_id)` triple
via the term-encoding shaper used by `pgrdf.sparql`. The
`template` may contain constants, variables, or blank nodes;
constants resolve to dictionary ids ahead of execution, variables
substitute per solution, and blank nodes generate fresh per-solution
ids via `oxrdf::BlankNode::default()`.

Reuse of v0.3 machinery:
- BGP translation: existing `build_from_and_where`.
- Term shaping: existing `JsonBuilder` from `src/query/executor.rs`.
- Aggregates / DISTINCT / etc. on CONSTRUCT are explicitly not in
  scope — per W3C SPARQL 1.1 §16.2 CONSTRUCT's solution sequence is
  the BGP's, no modifiers.

### 6.3 Acceptance criteria (v0.4 gate)

- `CONSTRUCT { ?s ex:tag "x" } WHERE { ?s rdf:type ex:Item }`
  returns one row per matched subject, each row carrying the
  fully-instantiated triple.
- **Round-trip.** `pgrdf.construct(q)` followed by re-inserting the
  rows via `pgrdf.put_quad` produces the same graph state (modulo
  dictionary id reshuffles, which are not user-visible).
- Constant-only templates resolve dictionary ids once, not per row
  (verified by `pgrdf.stats() → dict_db_calls` not increasing
  monotonically with output cardinality).
- Blank nodes in the template generate fresh ids per solution
  (covered by a regression that hashes the output and asserts no
  duplicate blank-node label appears across solutions).

## 7. Property paths (deferred from v0.3, now in scope)

Consumers traversing transitive class hierarchies via
`rdfs:subClassOf*`-style patterns hit the v0.3 limitation: only
direct predicate matches are supported. v0.4 adds the core path
operators. 🚧

### 7.1 Surface

| Operator | SPARQL syntax | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `*` zero-or-more | `?s ex:knows* ?o` | Reflexive transitive closure of `ex:knows`. |
| `+` one-or-more | `?s ex:knows+ ?o` | Transitive closure (non-reflexive). |
| `?` zero-or-one | `?s ex:knows? ?o` | Either equal or directly linked. |
| `^` inverse | `?s ^ex:knows ?o` | Equivalent to `?o ex:knows ?s`. |
| `\|` alternation | `?s (ex:a\|ex:b) ?o` | Stretch goal — included if the translator refactor is cheap; explicitly gated. |

Sequence paths (`p1/p2`) are already representable as multi-pattern
BGPs and do not need new translator support.

### 7.2 Translation strategy

Property paths translate to recursive Postgres CTEs:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE walk(src, dst, depth) AS (
    SELECT subject_id, object_id, 1
    FROM _pgrdf_quads
    WHERE predicate_id = $P AND graph_id = $G
  UNION
    SELECT w.src, q.object_id, w.depth + 1
    FROM walk w
    JOIN _pgrdf_quads q ON q.subject_id = w.dst
    WHERE q.predicate_id = $P AND w.depth < $MAX_DEPTH
)
SELECT ...
```

Path-operator mapping:
- `+`: the CTE as written.
- `*`: union with `SELECT ?s ?s FROM _pgrdf_quads` (reflexive base case)
  per spec.
- `?`: union of direct match and identity.
- `^`: swap `subject_id` and `object_id` in the base case (and join
  predicate), no recursion needed.
- `|` (if shipped): the base case becomes a union of per-predicate
  scans.

**Materialised-closure detection.** If the graph has been
materialised under a profile (OWL-RL or RDFS — see
[`v0.5-FUTURE §3`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE.md)) that already
entails the closure of the path's predicate, the translator falls
back to a direct BGP match against the materialised triples. No
recursion is emitted.

Heuristic for v0.4: if `_pgrdf_quads` carries `is_inferred = TRUE`
rows whose `predicate_id` corresponds to one of the well-known
transitive predicates (`rdfs:subClassOf`, `rdfs:subPropertyOf`,
`owl:sameAs`), the translator prefers a direct match over the CTE.
The detection is per-query, not cached; a future refinement would
record materialised-closure metadata on `_pgrdf_graphs`.

**Depth-guard.** `$MAX_DEPTH` defaults to 64. Configurable via a
new GUC `pgrdf.path_max_depth` (range 1..1024). Queries whose
solution path exceeds the depth are truncated, not errored — a
warning surfaces on `pgrdf.stats()` as `path_depth_truncations`.

### 7.3 Acceptance criteria (v0.4 gate)

- `?c rdfs:subClassOf* <http://example.org/Top>` traverses the full
  chain on a non-materialised graph (regression: chain of length 10
  resolves all 10 subclasses).
- The same query on a materialised graph (post-`pgrdf.materialize`)
  emits no recursive CTE in the executed plan — verified by a
  regression test that scrapes the `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)` output
  for the absence of `CTE Scan`.
- `?s ^p ?o` round-trips: the result set is identical to
  `?o p ?s` over the same graph.
- A query that would traverse beyond
  `pgrdf.path_max_depth` returns the truncated solution set and
  bumps `path_depth_truncations` in `pgrdf.stats()`.

## 8. Reasoning profile selector — moved to v0.5-FUTURE

The reasoning-profile selector on `pgrdf.materialize` (RDFS vs OWL-RL
vs `owl-rl-ext`) is deferred to v0.5. See
[`SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE §3`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE.md) for
the surface sketch and acceptance criteria. v0.4 keeps
`pgrdf.materialize(graph_id) → JSONB` unchanged from v0.3.

## 9. SHACL real integration (✅ shipped in v0.4 cycle)

`pgrdf.validate(data_graph_id, shapes_graph_id) → JSONB` ships as a
real W3C-shape SHACL Core validator in v0.4. The v0.3 stub is gone.
The SQL surface signature is unchanged from v0.3 — only the JSONB
body's keys shifted from `{status: "stub", reason: …}` to a W3C
`sh:ValidationReport`-shape document. Landed on `main` in commit
[`ac40bc2`](https://github.com/styk-tv/pgRDF/commit/ac40bc2);
covered by regression
[`tests/regression/sql/71-shacl-real.sql`](../tests/regression/sql/71-shacl-real.sql)
and three `#[pg_test]` integration tests in
`src/validation/shacl.rs` (conforming, violations, unknown graphs).
Unblock vehicle: [`ERRATA.v0.4`](ERRATA.v0.4.md) E-011.

### 9.1 Body shape

```json
{
  "conforms":        <bool>,
  "results":         [ ValidationResult, ... ],
  "data_graph_id":   <i64>,
  "shapes_graph_id": <i64>,
  "data_triples":    <i64>,
  "shapes_triples":  <i64>,
  "elapsed_ms":      <f64>
}
```

Each `ValidationResult` is:

```json
{
  "focusNode":      "<iri-or-bnode-or-literal-encoded>",
  "resultPath":     "<iri-or-null>",
  "sourceShape":    "<iri-or-bnode-or-null>",
  "resultMessage":  "<string-or-null>",
  "resultSeverity": "sh:Violation|sh:Warning|sh:Info|sh:Trace|sh:Debug",
  "value":          "<term-encoded-or-null>",
  "sourceConstraintComponent": "<iri>"
}
```

### 9.2 Engine + pipeline

The implementation in `src/validation/shacl.rs`:

1. Rehydrates both graphs from `_pgrdf_quads` JOIN
   `_pgrdf_dictionary` (same shape as `pgrdf.materialize`).
2. Serialises each graph to N-Triples via `oxttl::NTriplesSerializer`.
3. Builds `rudof_rdf::rdf_impl::InMemoryGraph::from_str` instances
   from the N-Triples text.
4. Compiles the shapes graph into a SHACL `IRSchema` via
   `shacl::validator::store::ShaclDataManager::load`.
5. Wraps the data graph as a `shacl::validator::store::Graph` and
   constructs a `GraphValidation` validator.
6. Runs `validator.validate(&schema, &ShaclValidationMode::Native)`.
7. Maps the resulting `ValidationReport.results()` into JSONB,
   normalising severities to the canonical `sh:` constants and
   rendering literals in Turtle-ish form.

### 9.3 Unblock vehicle (ERRATA.v0.4 E-011)

Two upstream-side preconditions cleared during the v0.4 cycle:

1. **rudof 0.3.1 consolidation (2026-05-12).** `shacl_ast` +
   `shacl_validation` 0.2.x merged into a single `shacl 0.3.1`
   crate, closing the `iri_s` → `rudof_iri` migration half of
   ERRATA.v0.2 E-009.
2. **Patched `reasonable` fork (styk-tv branch
   `rdf12-passthrough`).** Adds a `#[cfg(feature = "rdf-12")]
   TermRef::Triple(_) => panic!(...)` arm in
   `lib/src/common.rs:140` plus a passthrough feature
   `rdf-12 = ["oxrdf/rdf-12"]`. Strictly additive; lets pgRDF
   compose `shacl 0.3` (which hard-enables `rdf-12` via
   `rudof_rdf`) with `reasonable` 0.4.x in the same workspace.
   See [`ERRATA.v0.4`](ERRATA.v0.4.md) E-011 for the full patch
   summary.

The fork is wired via `[patch.crates-io]` in
[`Cargo.toml`](../Cargo.toml). Once `gtfierro/reasonable` merges
the upstream PR (held in the fork as `PR-DRAFT.md`), drop the
patch and pin the released `reasonable` version.

### 9.4 Acceptance criteria (v0.4 gate — landed ✅)

- A SHACL `sh:NodeShape` with `sh:property` + `sh:datatype`
  reports a violation on a focus node whose data is missing the
  required property. Regression:
  [`tests/regression/sql/71-shacl-real.sql`](../tests/regression/sql/71-shacl-real.sql).
- The report's `conforms` flag is `false` iff `results[]` is
  non-empty, and `true` otherwise.
- Each violation carries a `sh:Violation` severity by default;
  shape-author `sh:severity` declarations override.
- The data + shapes graphs are rehydrated from pgRDF's storage —
  no external file IO, no external SPARQL endpoint — so the
  validator runs inside the calling Postgres transaction.

Sample violation output (from `71-shacl-real.sql`, Alice missing
required `ex:age`):

```json
{
  "conforms": false,
  "results": [{
    "focusNode": "http://example.org/alice",
    "resultPath": "http://example.org/age",
    "sourceShape": "_:b887c79907df332dbd793b0bc80edbd5",
    "resultMessage": "MinCount(1) not satisfied",
    "resultSeverity": "sh:Violation",
    "sourceConstraintComponent": "http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#MinCountConstraintComponent",
    "value": null
  }],
  "data_graph_id": 8971,
  "shapes_graph_id": 8972,
  "data_triples": 5,
  "shapes_triples": 10,
  "elapsed_ms": 1.68
}
```

### 9.5 Forward look — moved to v0.5-FUTURE

Validation-against-materialised-graph, SHACL-SPARQL constraint mode,
and the W3C SHACL manifest runner all move forward to
[`SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE §5/§6`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE.md).
v0.4 ships the Core-`Native` mode only.

## 10. TriG / N-Quads ingest — moved to v0.5-FUTURE

TriG and N-Quads ingest UDFs (`pgrdf.parse_trig`, `pgrdf.parse_nquads`)
move forward to
[`SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE §4`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE.md).
v0.4 retains Turtle-only ingest from v0.3.

## 11. SPARQL surface backlog (deferred from v0.3, now in scope)

These items were enumerated under "⏳ v0.4" in
[`v0.3 §3`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.3.md). v0.4 ships them together with
§4-§7 because the same translator machinery they need
(LATERAL-style derived-table refactor + AST substitution) is the
same machinery §4 (UPDATE) and §6 (CONSTRUCT) need. Ship together
for economy. 🚧

- **Multi-triple `OPTIONAL { BGP }`.** The v0.3 OPTIONAL handler
  supports a single-triple right side. v0.4 extends it to N-triple
  BGPs by emitting a LATERAL-style derived-table inside the LEFT
  JOIN.
- **`VALUES` inline tables.** Translates to a derived-table /
  CTE that materialises the inline rows; the BGP joins against it
  on the bound variables.
- **`BIND` output downstream.** AST substitution pass: every
  reference to a `BIND`-introduced variable in a later FILTER or
  BGP rewrites to the bound expression. The v0.3 limitation
  (BIND projection-only) lifts.
- **Aggregates over `UNION`.** Derived-table refactor: the UNION
  becomes a sub-SELECT, aggregation runs over its rows. Residual
  refinements after the v0.4 cut move to
  [`v0.5-FUTURE §8`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE.md).
- **`DESCRIBE`.** Like CONSTRUCT but returning the closure around
  the described subject (every triple where the subject is the
  named term, transitively expanded one hop on blank nodes per
  W3C §16.4). Routes through `pgrdf.construct` internally for the
  triple-output shape.

Acceptance criteria for each carry the v0.3 LLD's existing wording:
the relevant regression file gains the deferred shape, the
`unsupported_algebra` entry for that form disappears from
`pgrdf.sparql_parse` output.

## 12. Performance work carried forward from v0.3

- **Phase 3 step 3b** — `heap_multi_insert` / `COPY BINARY` ingest
  path. The 2× wall-clock target from
  [`v0.3 §4.3`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.3.md) phase B remains unmet. v0.4
  targets shipping this. Acceptance fixture
  (`tests/regression/sql/52-bulk-ingest-perf.sql`) is already in
  place from v0.3 — re-measure once phase B lands. 🚧
- **Postgres custom-scan hooks** for specific quad-shape access
  patterns. v0.4 is the earliest target; may slip to v0.5 if the
  refactor cost exceeds the §4 / §6 wins. Acceptance: measurable
  wall-clock win on a single-predicate, single-graph SELECT against
  a materialised closure. 🚧

These do not gate the surface work in §3-§7; they ship in their
own slices.

## 13. Test policy (continues v0.3 §6, unchanged in spirit)

- Every new UDF lands with at least one `#[pg_test]` and at least
  one pg_regress fixture.
- No `ACCEPT=1` autobaselining of new query coverage. Expected
  outputs are hand-computed from the SQL + spec.
- The W3C SPARQL 1.1 manifest runner (Phase 6 step 2, gated `if: false`
  in v0.3) is wired in v0.4 — it gates §11's SPARQL backlog
  automatically as the deferred forms come online. 🚧
- Test bar at the start of the v0.4 cycle (post-SHACL slice):
  **94 pgrx + 40 pg_regress + 23 W3C + 3 LUBM = 160 tests** green.
  The v0.4 cut targets pg_regress growth to roughly 60-something
  files across §3-§7 and §11.
  Approximate breakdown:
  - §3 named-graph + IRI mapping: 6-8 files
    (`70-graph-iri-map.sql`, `71-graph-scoped-select.sql`,
    `72-graph-var-projection.sql`, `73-pg-dump-roundtrip.sql`, …).
  - §4 UPDATE: 8-10 files
    (`74-update-insert-data.sql`, `75-update-delete-data.sql`,
    `76-update-where.sql`, `77-update-delete-insert-where.sql`,
    `78-update-graph-scoped.sql`, …).
  - §5 lifecycle: 4 files
    (`82-drop-graph.sql`, `83-clear-graph.sql`,
    `84-copy-graph.sql`, `85-move-graph.sql`).
  - §6 CONSTRUCT: 3-4 files.
  - §7 paths: 5-6 files (one per operator + materialised-fallback
    detection).
  - §11 SPARQL backlog: 5-6 files.

The exact numbering will be set during implementation; the policy
is that every UDF and every translator path takes its own file.

## 14. Out of scope (carry forward, unchanged from v0.3)

- Streaming replication / logical decoding of RDF state.
- Federated SPARQL `SERVICE` — not in v0.4, v0.5, or v1.0 as
  currently scoped.
- Full OWL 2 (EL / QL) reasoning (`ERRATA.v0.2.md` E-002 — pgRDF
  ships OWL 2 RL only via `reasonable`).
- Backup/restore for opaque binary state (tracked by future
  `SPEC.pgRDF.BACKUP.v0.x`, INSTALL §11 OQ5).
- `LOAD <url>` in SPARQL UPDATE — explicitly not in scope for §4;
  callers fetch externally and invoke `pgrdf.load_turtle` or
  `pgrdf.parse_trig` directly.

## 15. Forward look — see v0.5-FUTURE

The detailed forward look (reasoning-profile selector, TriG/N-Quads
ingest, SHACL-SPARQL mode, W3C SHACL manifest runner, lifecycle IRI
overloads, aggregates-over-UNION refinements, RDF 1.2 triple terms,
incremental materialisation, federated `SERVICE`) lives in
[`SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE.md`](SPEC.pgRDF.LLD.v0.5-FUTURE.md).

## 16. Errata

- This document is the authoritative-in-progress v0.4 contract.
  Items shipped on `main` are marked ✅; items still in flight are
  marked 🚧. The document is updated in the same slice that
  changes a status marker.
- [`ERRATA.v0.4.md`](ERRATA.v0.4.md) is the v0.4-era spec-deltas
  log. E-011 tracks the upstream `reasonable` patch that unblocked
  §9 SHACL real-impl.
- [`ERRATA.v0.2.md`](ERRATA.v0.2.md) remains authoritative for
  pre-v0.3 items still live (E-006 pgrx 0.18, E-007
  `extension_control_path`, E-008 Linux builder, E-010 cargo audit).
  **E-009** (SHACL upstream conflict) is resolved in v0.4 cycle via
  E-011; final close-out gates on the upstream `reasonable` PR merge.
